The only way to mutate the <code>store</code> is <code>Data (Reducer)</code> and to trigger reducer and make use of it we need to dispatch an <code>Data (Action)</code>. The <code>Data (Action)</code> is triggered by the <code>Service (Middleware)</code> and the <code>Service (Middleware)</code> is triggered by the <code>Service (Action)</code>. The <code>Service (Action)</code> is triggered by the <code>Controller (React)</code> and the <code>Controller (React)</code> is triggered by the <code>View (React)</code>. The <code>View (React)</code> is rendered by the <code>Controller (React)</code> and the <code>Controller (React)</code> is rendered by the <code>App</code>. The <code>Controller</code> is solely responsible to get the data handle events while the <code>View</code> is only responsible to render the data.</p><h2 id="why-it-is-important" tabindex="-1">Why it is important? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-it-is-important" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why it is important?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When Building Large Scalable Application working with react requires you to follow some design principles and patterns. But Following the Design Principle and creating managle component can be hard and time consuming. Even though it is possible to create managable components but making good folder structure and managing the state can be hard. It is proven that <code>Redux</code> can handle state managemenet effeciently. So We Injected <code>Redux</code> into <code>React</code> and created a framework that follows the design principles and patterns and makes it easy to create managable components.</p>',13),r=[i];function n(s,l,h,u,p,m){return o(),t("div",null,r)}const w=e(a,[["render",n]]);export{g as __pageData,w as default};
